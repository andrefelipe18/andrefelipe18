# Hello there! 🫨

I like coding, I worked as a designer in the past and computers have always been my passion.

In 2021, I found myself in the Laravel and Vue stack and since then I've been an active and committed member of this community, constantly seeking to contribute and learn.

🧑🏼‍💻 My stack:
- PHP (Laravel, Livewire, Filament)
- JavaScript (Vue❤️, Nuxt, Alpine, React😒)
- Tailwind CSS
- MySQL & PostgreSQL
- Docker

📈 A few projects
- [VFull](https://github.com/andrefelipe18/VFull)
- [Tailhub](https://tailhub.vercel.app)
- [Filament Partials](https://github.com/andrefelipe18/filament-partials)
