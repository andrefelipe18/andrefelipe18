# Hello there! 🫨

I like coding, I worked as a designer in the past and computers have always been my passion.

In 2022, I found myself in the Laravel and Vue stack and since then I've been an active and committed member of this community, constantly seeking to contribute and learn.

🧑🏼‍💻 My stack:
- PHP (Laravel, Livewire, Filament)
- JavaScript (Vue❤️, Nuxt, Alpine, React😒)
- Tailwind CSS
- MySQL & PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Git
- Linux (Ubuntu)

📚 My hobbies:
- Playing video games (I really like Hades)
- Listening to music (I'm a big fan of Froid)
- Studying (I'm a big fan of learning)
